    wants to become competitive, or a swimmer wanting to improve your stroke. Combined with our summer league program, RSTA Winter Swim offers a year round
    swimming experience.

    Beginning this year we are offering a Sunday morning program geared towards beginners aged 6 to 10. This program focuses on developing proper stroke
    technique. All coaches work on deck and in water with the swimmer to improve their technique.

    If you are a swimmer new to RSTA, by participating in the Winter Swim program and meeting the following requirements, you will be able to skip the new swim
    test requirement while registering for the summer league.
