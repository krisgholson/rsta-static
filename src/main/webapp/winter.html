<p>Hello new and returning swimmers.</p>

<p>We are happy to see that are interested in the RSTA Winter Swim program. We offer a variety of programs to suit your needs, whether you are beginner who wants to become competitive, or a swimmer wanting to improve your stroke. Combined with our summer league program, RSTA Winter Swim offers a year round swimming experience.</p> 
<h3>New Sunday Morning class begins September 8th.</h3>
<p>Beginning this year we are offering a Sunday morning program geared towards beginners aged 6 to 10. This program focuses on developing proper stroke technique. All coaches work on deck and in water with the swimmer to improve their technique.</p>

<h3>Changes to the program beginning this year.</h3>
<p>If you are a swimmer new to RSTA, by participating in the Winter Swim program and meeting the following requirements, you will be able to skip the new swim test requirement while registering for the summer league.</p>
<ol>
<li><h3>Attendance requirement</h3>
You have to attend at least 8 Sunday classes or 15 Tuesday/Thursday classes.<h3>
AND</h3></li>
<li><h3>Waiver required for Swim Test</h3>
You will need a waiver from the Head coach at the end of your enrolled session.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Swim test option</h3>
<p>If you do not have a waiver from the Head coach, you can request a swim test at the end of your session. Successfully passing this swim test will address the second requirement. </p>

<p>Failing to meet the above requirement will require you to take the new swim test at the time of registration for the summer league.</p>


<h3>2013 - 2014 schedule</h3>
<p>The Sunday Morning, Sunday Night, Tuesday/Thursday Night sessions will begin second week of September. Detailed schedule will be posted shortly.</p>

<p>Registrations will open towards the middle of August.</p>

<p>Thank you</p>
