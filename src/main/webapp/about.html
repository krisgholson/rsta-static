<ul>
<li>Please note that there will be continuous warm-ups in the "short lanes" throughout the meet, starting at 6:30AM.  These lanes are for All Star swimmers ONLY and are to be used for continuous swimming to warm up before a race or to cool down immediately after racing.  No standing or playing around in these lanes!  No diving!  Meet marshalls will be in place to monitor safety in these lanes.  </li>
<li>Due to the excessive heat, RA will be providing lifeguards to monitor the shallow end of the pool (where there are no lane lines).  This area will be open for quick dips for spectators to cool off.  The area is NOT meant for open play time or horsing around, so parents, please monitor your children.  Safety is our number one priority and if there is excessive play in the shallow end, we will end up having to close that area for cooling off. This area will only be a available during certain times for dips when the lifeguards are in the stands; everyone must follow lifeguard directions in that area of the pool"</li>
