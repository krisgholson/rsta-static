<p style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The
	Reston Swim Team Association (RSTA) is a summer swim league open to all
	swimmers between the ages of 6 and 18. The objective and primary
	purpose of the RSTA is the education of all individuals ages 6-18 for
	the purpose of developing and improving their capabilities in the sport
	of swimming. In addition to the development of competitive skills, the
	RSTA promotes the virtues of good conduct and sportsmanship.</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">RSTA
		brings together up to 990 swimmers from the greater Reston area. These
		swimmers practice and compete on nine teams with up to 110 swimmers
		per team. During the course of a season from late May to the end of
		July, swimmers practice almost daily and compete in 6 dual meets, an
		Individual Medley meet, and a select All-Star meet. Coaches for each
		team are hired each summer. Many are current or former RSTA swimmers.
